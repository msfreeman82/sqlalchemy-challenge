# sqlalchemy-challenge

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that I need to take to accomplish this task.

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, I’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, I’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. To do so, complete the following steps:

I’ll use the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete my climate analysis and data exploration.

Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to my SQLite database.

Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect my tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.
